# puppeteer-toolbox

(An idea for the project)

There are over [1000 projects](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/puppeteer) depending on puppeteer. They need to do some similar tasks, for example:

- [print human-readable version of JSHandle](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/2083#issuecomment-380287424)
- [imporve stack trace with sourcemaps](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/985)
- implement crawler
- [extract critical CSS](https://github.com/peterbe/minimalcss)

So idea is to create standard library for the [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).
